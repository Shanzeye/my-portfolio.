      <p className="section-description">I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of design and technology. What started as a hobby of tinkering with HTML and CSS has grown into a full-fledged career. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in web development, focusing on front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React.js and Next.js. I believe in continuously learning, so I stay up to date with the latest tools, frameworks, and trends to ensure my work is both innovative and effective.
